Intro

  Hi, my name is Simon, creator of Death-Machine.  

Context

  Games will be a huge segment of the market.  

Problem:

  Even with increased l2 scalability lots of computation still needs to be offloaded

Current Solutions

  1) Zordle - first game to use WASM / recursive ZK-snarks in the browser
  2) Dark-Forest ETH - fog of war to hide players location 

Your Solution:

  Death-Machine uses recursive zk-Snarks to execute game logic off chain and hide solutions.

Details:

  Imagine a layer-2 that lives on your computer for 5-minutes.
