# Announcing Death-Machine

Today we are extremely excited to announce the beta-launch of Death-Machine, a fully-onchain game powered by Starknet.  

## What 

In Death-Machine players control three spaceships and compete to navigate through a procedurally generated galaxy.  During each turn players design a sequince of moves for their spaceships, and then submit those moves on-chain.  

This game was build around three design principles:

    1) Intuitive UI
    2) Simple to learn, hard to master
    3) Enable by the blockchain, not limited

Development began in Febuary of this.  Over the past few months, I've been thinking a lot about on-chain interactions between humans and computers.  The classic example of this is MEV.  I wanted to build a game that closely mirrored interactions that are already happening on chain, specifically the hunt for MEV, and raise the level of abstraction to something that everyone can participate in. 

## Lessons 

The blockchain is an enabling factor, not a limiting one.  We ofter hear about the difficulty of designing crypto specific software.  Much of this is true, the technology is complex.
